## 📝Description

Currently, most carpooling systems are in the control of the industry giants like Ola, Uber and several others. Thave all the data of drivers as well as of riders and this can lead to major privacy issues.
This project therefore aims to move ride-sharing and car hire are to blockchain in order to build a much more secure and reliable carpooling system that would connect the rider and driver directly using "smart contracts" without the intervention of any third party.

1. **Decentralized Network**: A Carpooling Dapp platform based on blockchain operates on a decentralized network, eliminating the need for intermediaries.
2. **Secure Transactions**: The platform uses blockchain technology to secure and track transactions between users, ensuring the safety and transparency of financial transactions.
3. **Smart Contracts**: The platform can be powered by smart contracts, automatically executing the terms of a carpooling agreement without intermediaries.
4. **Data Privacy**: User data is protected by the immutable and secure nature of blockchain technology, ensuring privacy and security.

## 🛠Project Setup

> Want to setup this project on your machine? Follow these steps:

* STEP 1: [Install Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm): Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It allows developers to build server-side applications in JavaScript and run them on the server. It includes a rich library of modules, known as npm (Node Package Manager), that enables developers to add functionality to their applications quickly and easily. It is widely used for web application development, building networked applications, and developing server-side scripts.
* STEP 2: [Install and configure MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/) MongoDB is a popular, open-source NoSQL database management system. It is classified as a document-oriented database, which means that it stores data in the form of documents (in BSON format) instead of traditional table-based relational databases.
* STEP 3: [Install Metamask Extension](https://metamask.io/) MetaMask is a browser extension and mobile app that provides an interface for interacting with decentralized applications (dApps) built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to securely store, manage, and send Ethereum and other Ethereum-based tokens, as well as interact with dApps in a user-friendly way.
* STEP 4: [Configure a Metamask Account](https://docs.metamask.io/guide/#why-metamask)
* STEP 5: Navigate to the repository and clone it: [Clone our GitHub Respository](https://github.com/zainab-06-p/Carpooling-dapp)
